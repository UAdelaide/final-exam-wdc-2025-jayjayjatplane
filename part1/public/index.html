            <p>From Wikipedia: The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the
                gray wolf. Also
                called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from a population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene
                by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago
                and before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained
                the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.

                Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds
                vary widely in shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the
                tail), powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight.
                Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs
                perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship,
                therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.</p>
